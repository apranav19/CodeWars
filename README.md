CodeWars
=============

I discovered CodeWars a year ago and I'm trying to get back on it again. It's an interesting site that lets you challenge yourself with programming problems.

The 3 primary languages they support are: JavaScript, CoffeeScript, & Ruby.
Although I'll post Pythonic solutions, I'll try posting JS & Ruby code on a frequent basis.
